GTasker
=======

GTasker is a web interface to put multiple Google Tasks windows side-by-side. It's great. I didn't create it, and the site and html file had no copyright, attribution or license. 

*Update: Someone with a username *cmikec* may have created this (see this post on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2278860)).*

It was originally hosted at gtasker.com, but when that domain lapsed and the html+javascript was no longer available, I reconstituted it from the [Internet Archive Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/). I fixed some of the JavaScript that was broken, and then hosted it on my own website [justinh.org](http://justinh.org).

When I stopped using GTasker in 2013, I posted it here to make it easy for people to download/fork it for themselves. 

Read my two posts about it:
* [gtasker â€“ reposting a great Google Tasks tool](http://justinh.org/2012/03/26/gtasker-reposting-a-great-google-tasks-tool/)
* [Fixing gtasker](http://justinh.org/2013/01/26/fixing-gtasker/)

Cheers!
