gtasker
=======

**gtasker** is a web interface to put multiple Google Tasks windows side-by-side. You can configure it to display multiple rows and/or columns. How does it accomplish this magic? Iframes and a bit of JavaScript.

It's great, and works as of March 2017 in both Chrome 57 and Safari 10.1 on MacOS. I didn't create it, and the site and html file had no copyright, attribution or license.

*Update: Someone with a username *cmikec* may have created this (see this post on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2278860)).*

It was originally hosted at gtasker.com, but when that domain lapsed and the html+JavaScript was no longer available, I reconstituted it from the [Internet Archive Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/). I fixed some of the JavaScript that was broken, and then hosted it for a time on my own website [justinh.org](http://justinh.org).

When I stopped using gtasker in 2013, I posted it here to make it easy for people to download/fork it for themselves.

Read my two posts about it:
* [gtasker â€“ reposting a great Google Tasks tool](http://justinh.org/2012/03/26/gtasker-reposting-a-great-google-tasks-tool/)
* [Fixing gtasker](http://justinh.org/2013/01/26/fixing-gtasker/)


Next steps for anyone that would like to fork this:
* Remove the extraneous Wayback Machine code still present.
* Fix the occasional error where the Google Tasks interface renders about 15px too tall at first, but fixes itself upon screen resize.


Cheers!
